# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## How to Run the Repository

To run the repository, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
3. Start the server by running `npm run server`.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
